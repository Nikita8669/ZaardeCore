Zaarde Coin
The Zaarde (ZARD) blockchain is completely decentralized and 100% Proof of Stake (POS) and Masternode (MN) based in order to ensure its longevity and reduce Zaarde's greenhouse footprint in a period of heavy energy usage by cryptocurrency miners. 

ZARD's multiple desktop wallet applications are simple to use and send/receive transactions are nearly instantaneous, with new blocks being generated every 60 seconds surpassing BTC speeds.

Unlike many other POS and MN-based currencies, ZARD block rewards start at just 0.1 ZARD and slowly increase over time before then decreasing at a similar rate. Coin supply is therefore regulated and a 30-year gap is created between the ZARD genesis block and maximum supply is reached.
